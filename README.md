The project is designed to offer a comprehensive platform for mastering technical interviews, primarily focused on LeetCode questions, by providing a rich set of features including problem sets, real-time chat-based guidance, dynamic graphical problem visualization, and future enhancements such as performance analytics and statistical feedback on solutions.

## Key Features
- [X] Problem set with **over 300 LeetCode questions**;

- [X] A real-time and problem-specific **Chat Agent** designed exclusively to helping you solve your problem!

- [X] **Dynamic Graphical Visualization** to represent your problem. 

### Future Implementation:

- [ ] **Performance Analytics**: We hope to cater the project even more to our users by providing them data analysis of their progress and performance with chat history!

- [ ] **Statistical Feedback on your Solution**: Our AI will eventually rate your solutions based on optimal runtime and space complexities, and treat it as a metric to track your performance.
